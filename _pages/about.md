I am an ecologist interested in the links between global environmental change, biodiversity, ecosystem health, and human well-being.

I am currently a AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow with NASA's Earth Science Division, where I support the Biological Diversity and Terrestrial Ecology Programs and will be starting a faculty position in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of Texas at Austin in Fall 2023.
